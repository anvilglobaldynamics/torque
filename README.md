# What is Torque and what is Lipi?

Torque is the codename for Lipi for Businessâ€™s codebase. Lipi is an easy-to-adopt and easy-to-use mobile-first business management solution for medium size retailers. It is coded from scratch by the 2 authors and aims to be the first business management app for small-medium retail owners operating in growing economies.

# Why is Lipi / Torque open source?

Initially started by 2 authors, the project now requires more contribution to grow and sustain. Moreover, an open source codebase brings transparency and credibility to an application which handles sensitive business data.
